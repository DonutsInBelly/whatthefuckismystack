# What The Fuck Is My Stack?

# How does it work?

When you enter a word into the input box, it parses each letter of the word and makes a request based on each letter it finds. Then it figures out the size of the available letter bank and randomly chooses a word in the bank. Then it all gets assembled into the list you see on the website.

The letter banks are available in https://github.com/dominusbelli/whatthefuckismystack/tree/master/data
